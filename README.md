# 📚 Student Activities and Performance Analysis

This project explores how various student activities, such as studying hours, sleep habits, and extracurricular engagement, affect academic performance.  
Using **Multiple Linear Regression**, we predict a student's **Performance Index** based on several features.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Entries:** 1000 students
- **Features:**
  - Studying Hours
  - Sleep Hours
  - Sample Question Papers Practiced
  - Extracurricular Activities
  - Previous Scores
  - Math Score
  - Reading Score
  - Writing Score
- **Target Variable:** Performance Index

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps

- Checked for missing values and cleaned the data
- Label encoded the **Extracurricular Activities** feature
- Explored feature correlations to identify key predictors

---

## 🔥 Model Building

- Split the data into **Training** and **Testing** sets
- Trained a **Multiple Linear Regression** model
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **R² Score**: 0.9166
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 4.378
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 5.645

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieved high predictive accuracy with an R² score of **91.6%**
- Scatter plots were used to visualize actual vs predicted values
- Model interpretation suggests that study habits and extracurriculars significantly influence academic performance
